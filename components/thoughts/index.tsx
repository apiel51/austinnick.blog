      This is a list of some things that have crossed my mind. Some are deep,
      some are not. Items are placed in reverse chronological order. Thoughts I
      find especially important are bolded.

          Raising money from a great investor provides you with not just money,
          but an influential group/individual having a vested interest in the
          success of your company.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whenever messaging someone at work and referring to a document (e.g.
          design doc, pull request) always send a link with it. It save the
          recipient the time of trying to find the referenced item.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's a good idea to work for the money-earning portion of a company.
          The company will hold that portion to a higher bar than, say, internal
          tools, that don't have as high of an ROI. More money = more reason to
          build high-quality software.

          There are too many valuable things to learn to waste time learning
          things that are not valuable

          Happiness is when you can view the present the same way you view a
          fond memory

        <li className="font-semibold">
          Embrace small activities that you know you'll never regret doing (some
          examples for me are brushing my teeth, doing the dishes). You will
          always feel better after doing them.
        </li>

          Having a roommate teaches you to compromise and sets you up to be a
          more reasonable person.
        </li>
        <li>
          I find "maturing" an enjoyable process when I embrace it instead of
          fight it.
        </li>
        <li>
          I only say "buh-bye" over the phone. Especially if it's with a
          stranger (like a customer service representative)
        </li>
        <li className="font-semibold">
          It's hard for me to have insightful or creative thoughts when sitting
          idly - my brain tends to think about all of the things that I should
          be doing instead of sitting down and thinking. But when I'm performing
          a menial task (showering, washing the dishes), that part of my brain
          turns off and allows for more unbound thinking.

          The only difference between a bad life and a good life is perspective.

          We often think we have 2 choices when making a decision. Too many
          people forget about the third option (

            <span className="underline cursor-pointer">door #3</span>
          </NextLink>
          ), which is to collect more information before making a decision.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is important to be able to cringe when looking back at things you
          did/said. It shows that you can be critical of your own behavior, and
          looking back at actions you regret is a good way to prevent behavior
          like that from surfacing again.

          I'm the happiest when I have a plan and feel like my life is in order.

          Don't shy away from doing the hard things. At some point you'll have
          to face the music.

          Journaling allows you to take a snapshot of your mental state at a
          given moment in time. This provides a solid reference point, as it can
          often be hard to recall exactly what we were thinking or how we were
          feeling in the past.
        </li>
        <li>
          Being observant allows you to learn so much more about the world.
        </li>
        <li>There's almost no better feeling than a fresh start.</li>
        <li>
          I dislike listening to music all the time. Sometimes silence is a good
          thing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Being in my early twenties, I am more self-aware of my own faults than
          ever before.

          If you feel like you need help, ask for it. You almost certainly won't
          regret it.

          Whether something is morally sound and whether it should be legal are
          two separate questions that may not have the same answer.

          Fulfillment and pleasure are almost always at odds with each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          It makes sense that most successful businesses were built by teams
          rather than individuals. Interdependence allows teams to stay
          motivated despite encountered setbacks â€” something much harder to do
          alone.

          You can expedite personal growth by learning to love stepping outside
          your comfort zone.

          Let people do nice things for you. Don't fight it, be grateful
          instead. It's a win for both parties.
